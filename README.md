# Evaluate the performance of each model
Contains the questions and answers to conclufe the homework and summarize outcomes:

Finally, use the testing data to evaluate each model and compare the performance.
Use the above to answer the following:

### Which model has a lower loss?
A: The fng has a loss: 0.1911, and closing has a loss: 0.0468. The lstm closing price model has a lower loss.
### Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
A: LSTM closing
### Which window size works best for the model?
A: I found that a window size of 10 seemed to work best, and yeild the best results.
